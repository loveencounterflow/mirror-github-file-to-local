# Mirror GitHub File to Local

mirror files on GitHub (or other remote locations) to local files; intended for 'lightweight' NodeJS
modules (packages)

## Use Together With

* [@vercel/ncc](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) is a *"[s]imple CLI for compiling a Node.js module into a
  single file, together with all its dependencies, gcc-style"*. At the inevitable cost of potentially
  duplicating some dependencies, Vercel&nbsp;NCC should be a great tool to transform a medium-complexity
  project with not too many, not too big dependencies into a single-file dependency that should be easy to
  handle with `mirror-github-file-to-local`

* [sverweij/dependency-cruiser](https://github.com/sverweij/dependency-cruiser) analyses source files for
  `require` and `import` statements; allows individual rulesets to warn when e.g. when modules from the
  NodeJS standard library are used (so the module might not be usable in the browser).

  **Note**: in the documentation, always replace `depcruise` with `dependency-cruiser`; the former is
  apparently a holdover from an earlier version of the software.

## To Do

* **`[—]`** allow patching downloaded files (eg. to manipulate hard-coded `require` paths)
* **`[—]`** allow running build commands to make desired files available (??? for the time being, maybe
  recommend to store locally)
* **`[—]`** amend `gaps-and-islands` with the 'skeleton' / POC implementations `mirror-with-git`,
  `mirror-with-wget`
* **`[—]`** do we want or don't we want 'detached head state' in downloaded Git repos?
* **`[—]`** use an aliasing setting to enable checking out different versions of the same repo
* **`[—]`** implement setting to copy / hardlink files into a given location instead of using symlinks
* **`[—]`** two modes of operation:
  * **`[—]`** replace-to-target: `<<insert>>` commands themselves will be replaced by text of target and
    will leave no trace
  * **`[—]`** insert-in-place: `<<insert>>` commands insert lines of target texts into the source file
    (normally below their respective `<<insert>>` command), followed by an EOI marker (see below) to
    delineate the target region
    * note that in-situ operation requires a host syntax with comments
  * it's possible in replace-to-target mode to overwrite the source file but that is a one-shot operation as
    the replacements would obliterate the `<<insert>>` commands so is not repeatable
* **`[—]`** proposed syntax:
  * surrounded by doube pointy brackets `<<insert ${arguments} ${path}>>`
  * `insert` (in contrast to `import`, `include`, `require`) indicating that source text to be interpolated
    in place
  * `${arguments}`:
    * `below` for 'below this line' (default);
    * `above` for 'above this line' (only allowed once in a file so it's possible to `insert` even a shebang
      line);
    * <del>`left` for 'to the left of this `<<insert>>`'</del> <ins>maybe later</ins>
  * need ability to declare comment syntax, e.g. simply by re-using an `<<insert>>` command's 'prefix'
    (everything before `<<` to the start of line)
  * need an extensible End Of Insert (EOI) marker:
    * use default: you write
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>
      ```
      which will be rewritten to
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>
      永和九年，岁在癸丑，暮春之初，会于会稽山阴之兰亭，修禊事也。
      # <</insert>>
      ```
    * define custom using `>>$EOI`: you write
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>custom EOI marker text
      ```
      which will be rewritten to
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>(custom EOI marker text
      永和九年，岁在癸丑，暮春之初，会于会稽山阴之兰亭，修禊事也。
      # custom EOI marker text<</insert>>
      ```
    * define custom using parenthiszed `>>$EOI`: you write
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>((custom EOI marker text
      ```
      which will be rewritten to
      ```
      # <<insert lantingxu.txt>>((custom EOI marker text
      永和九年，岁在癸丑，暮春之初，会于会稽山阴之兰亭，修禊事也。
      # custom EOI marker text))<</insert>>
      ```
    * the number of parentheses you give is a minimum—at least as many right parentheses will be
      auto-inserted at the closing insertion tag
    * `mirror-github-file-to-local` will check for the maximum number of consecutive right parens *m* in the
      inserted text; say you have
      ```
      # <<insert brackets.txt>>(((
      ```
      and `brackets.txt` contains the text `abc ))))) xyz` with 5 closing parens, then the result of the
      interpolation will be that text and a closing tag with *n*&nbsp;=&nbsp;*m*&nbsp;+&nbsp;1&nbsp;=&nbsp;6
      right parens:
      ```
      # <<insert brackets.txt>>((((((
      abc ))))) xyz
      # ))))))<</insert>>
      ```
    * invariants:
      * insert regions always start with `${prefix}<<insert\b`
      * headline of insert regions always ends with
        * either `>>` (for the default, will be expanded to `>>(${default_eoimarkertxt}`)
        * or with `>>` followed by any number *n* of left parens, followed by an optional marker text
          `${eoimarkertxt}`; EOI marker text may not include parentheses, newlines or control characters
      * insert regions always end with `${prefix}`, followed by `${eoimarkertxt}` (if any), followed by *n*
        right parens, followed by the constant `<</insert>>` (and discardable trailing whitespace), to the
        end of the line
      * `<<insert>>` commands can, in the first incarnation, not contain other `<<insert>>` commands
      * `<<insert>>` commands, `$eoimarkertxt`s and *functional* parentheses (in distinction to any
        parentheses that the inserted target may contain) are always balanced
* **`[—]`** make usable for other purposes:
  * **`[—]`** modular MarkDown documents
  * **`[—]`** bash scripts with inlined dependencies; consider to use something like `# <<insert above
    path/to/source>>`
